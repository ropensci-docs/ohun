# Evaluate the performance of a sound event detection procedure

`diagnose_detection` evaluates the performance of a sound event
detection procedure comparing the output selection table to a reference
selection table

## Usage

``` r
diagnose_detection(
  reference,
  detection,
  by.sound.file = FALSE,
  time.diagnostics = FALSE,
  cores = 1,
  pb = TRUE,
  path = NULL,
  by = NULL,
  macro.average = FALSE,
  min.overlap = 0.5,
  solve.ambiguous = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- reference:

  Data frame or 'selection.table' (following the warbleR package format)
  with the reference selections (start and end of the sound events) that
  will be used to evaluate the performance of the detection, represented
  by those selections in 'detection'. Must contained at least the
  following columns: "sound.files", "selec", "start" and "end". **It
  must contain the reference selections that will be used for detection
  optimization**.

- detection:

  Data frame or 'selection.table' with the detections (start and end of
  the sound events) that will be compared against the 'reference'
  selections. Must contained at least the following columns:
  "sound.files", "selec", "start" and "end". It can contain data for
  additional sound files not found in 'references'. In this case the
  routine assumes that no sound events are found in those files, so
  detection from those files are all false positives.

- by.sound.file:

  Logical argument to control whether performance diagnostics are
  summarized across sound files (when `by.sound.file = FALSE`, when more
  than 1 sound file is included in 'reference') or shown separated by
  sound file. Default is `FALSE`.

- time.diagnostics:

  Logical argument to control if diagnostics related to the duration of
  the sound events ("mean.duration.true.positives",
  "mean.duration.false.positives", "mean.duration.false.negatives" and
  "proportional.duration.true.positives") are returned (if `TRUE`).
  Default is `FALSE`.

- cores:

  Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied. It specifies
  the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel
  computing).

- pb:

  Logical argument to control progress bar. Default is `TRUE`.

- path:

  Character string containing the directory path where the sound files
  are located. If supplied then duty cycle (fraction of a sound file in
  which sounds were detected)is also returned. This feature is more
  helpful for tuning an energy-based detection. Default is `NULL`.

- by:

  Character vector with the name of a column in 'reference' for
  splitting diagnostics. Diagnostics will be returned separated for each
  level in 'by'. Default is `NULL`.

- macro.average:

  Logical argument to control if diagnostics are first calculated for
  each sound file and then averaged across sound files, which can
  minimize the effect of unbalanced sample sizes between sound files. If
  `FALSE` (default) diagnostics are based on aggregated statistics
  irrespective of sound files. The following indices can be estimated by
  macro-averaging: overlap, mean.duration.true.positives,
  mean.duration.false.positives, mean.duration.false.positives,
  mean.duration.false.negatives, proportional.duration.true.positives,
  recall and precision (f.score is always derived from recall and
  precision). Note that when applying macro-averaging, recall and
  precision are not derived from the true positive, false positive and
  false negative values returned by the function.

- min.overlap:

  Numeric. Controls the minimum amount of overlap required for a
  detection and a reference sound for it to be counted as true positive.
  Default is 0.5. Overlap is measured as intersection over union. Only
  used if `solve.ambiguous = TRUE`.

- solve.ambiguous:

  Logical argument to control whether ambiguous detections (i.e. split
  and merged positives) are solved using maximum bipartite graph
  matching. Default is `TRUE`. If `FALSE` ambiguous detections are not
  solved.

## Value

A data frame including the following detection performance diagnostics:

- `detections`: total number of detections

- `true.positives`: number of sound events in 'reference' that
  correspond to any detection. Matching is defined as some degree of
  overlap in time. In a perfect detection routine it should be equal to
  the number of rows in 'reference'.

- `false.positives`: number of detections that don't match (i.e. don't
  overlap with) any of the sound events in 'reference'. In a perfect
  detection routine it should be 0.

- `false.negatives`: number of sound events in 'reference' that were not
  detected (not found in 'detection'. In a perfect detection routine it
  should be 0.

- `splits`: number of detections overlapping reference sounds that also
  overlap with other detections. In a perfect detection routine it
  should be 0.

- `merges`: number of detections that overlap with two or more reference
  sounds. In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.

- `mean.duration.true.positives`: mean duration of true positives (in
  ms). Only included when `time.diagnostics = TRUE`.

- `mean.duration.false.positives`: mean duration of false positives (in
  ms). Only included when `time.diagnostics = TRUE`.

- `mean.duration.false.negatives`: mean duration of false negatives (in
  ms). Only included when `time.diagnostics = TRUE`.

- `overlap`: mean intersection over union overlap of true positives.

- `proportional.duration.true.positives`: ratio of duration of true
  positives to the duration of sound events in 'reference'. In a perfect
  detection routine it should be 1. Based only on true positives that
  were not split or merged.

- `duty.cycle`: proportion of a sound file in which sounds were
  detected. Only included when `time.diagnostics = TRUE` and `path` is
  supplied. Useful when conducting energy-based detection as a perfect
  detection can be obtained with a very low amplitude threshold, which
  will detect everything, but will produce a duty cycle close to 1.

- `recall`: Proportion of sound events in 'reference' that were
  detected. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1.

- `precision`: Proportion of detections that correspond to sound events
  in 'reference'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1.

- `f.score`: Combines recall and precision as the harmonic mean of these
  two. Provides a single value for evaluating performance. In a perfect
  detection routine it should be 1.

## Details

The function evaluates the performance of a sound event detection
procedure by comparing its output selection table to a reference
selection table in which all sound events of interest have been
selected. The function takes any overlap between detected sound events
and target sound events as true positives. Note that all sound files
located in the supplied 'path' will be analyzed even if not all of them
are listed in 'reference'. When several possible matching pairs of sound
event and detections are found, the optimal set of matching pairs is
found through maximum bipartite matching (using the R package igraph).
Priority for assigning a detection to a reference is given by the amount
of time overlap. 'splits' and 'merge.positives' are also counted (i.e.
counted twice) as 'true.positives'. Therefore "true.positives +
false.positives = detections".
