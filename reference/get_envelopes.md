# Extract absolute amplitude envelopes

`get_envelopes` extracts absolute amplitude envelopes to speed up energy
detection

## Usage

``` r
get_envelopes(
  path = ".",
  files = NULL,
  bp = NULL,
  hop.size = 11.6,
  wl = NULL,
  cores = 1,
  thinning = 1,
  pb = TRUE,
  smooth = 5,
  normalize = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- path:

  Character string containing the directory path where the sound files
  are located. The current working directory is used as default.

- files:

  character vector or indicating the sound files that will be analyzed.
  Supported file formats:'.wav', '.mp3', '.flac' and '.wac'. If not
  supplied the function will work on all sound files (in the supported
  format) in 'path'.

- bp:

  Numeric vector of length 2 giving the lower and upper limits of a
  frequency bandpass filter (in kHz). Default is `NULL`. Bandpass is
  done using the function
  [`ffilter`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/seewave/man/ffilter.html), which
  applies a short-term Fourier transformation to first create a
  spectrogram in which the target frequencies are filtered and then is
  back transformed into a wave object using a reverse Fourier
  transformation.

- hop.size:

  A numeric vector of length 1 specifying the time window duration (in
  ms). Default is 11.6 ms, which is equivalent to 512 wl for a 44.1 kHz
  sampling rate. Ignored if 'wl' is supplied.

- wl:

  A numeric vector of length 1 specifying the window length of the
  spectrogram. Default is `NULL`. If supplied, 'hop.size' is ignored.
  Used internally for bandpass filtering (so only applied when 'bp' is
  supplied).

- cores:

  Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied. It specifies
  the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel
  computing).

- thinning:

  Numeric vector of length 1 in the range 0~1 indicating the
  proportional reduction of the number of samples used to represent
  amplitude envelopes (i.e. the thinning of the envelopes). Usually
  amplitude envelopes have many more samples than those needed to
  accurately represent amplitude variation in time, which affects the
  size of the output (usually very large R objects / files). Default is
  `1` (no thinning). Higher sampling rates can afford higher size
  reduction (e.g. lower thinning values). Reduction is conducted by
  linear interpolation using
  [`approx`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/approxfun.html). Note that thinning
  may decrease time precision and that the higher the thinning the less
  precise the time detection. It's generally not advised if no smoothing
  ('smooth' argument) is applied.

- pb:

  Logical argument to control progress bar. Default is `TRUE`.

- smooth:

  A numeric vector of length 1 to smooth the amplitude envelope with a
  sum smooth function. It controls the time 'neighborhood' (in ms) in
  which amplitude samples are smoothed (i.e. averaged with neighboring
  samples). Default is 5. 0 means no smoothing is applied. Note that
  smoothing is applied before thinning (see 'thinning' argument). The
  function
  [`envelope`](https://marce10.github.io/warbleR/reference/envelope.html)
  is used internally which is analogous to sum smoothing in
  [`env`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/seewave/man/env.html). This argument is
  used internally by `get_envelopes`.

- normalize:

  Logical argument to control if envelopes are normalized to a 0-1
  range.

## Value

An object of class 'envelopes'.

## Details

This function extracts the absolute amplitude envelopes of sound files.
Can be used to manipulate envelopes before running
[`energy_detector`](https://docs.ropensci.org/ohun/reference/energy_detector.md).

## Examples

``` r
{
  # Save to temporary working directory
  data(list = c("lbh1", "lbh2"))
  tuneR::writeWave(lbh1, file.path(tempdir(), "lbh1.wav"))
  tuneR::writeWave(lbh2, file.path(tempdir(), "lbh2.wav"))

  # get raw absolute amplitude envelopes
  envs <- get_envelopes(path = tempdir())

  # extract segment for the first sound event in the first sound file
  x <- envs[[1]]$envelope

  # and plot it
  plot(x[(length(x) / 9):(length(x) / 4)], type = "l", xlab = "samples", ylab = "amplitude")

  # smoothing envelopes
  envs <- get_envelopes(path = tempdir(), smooth = 6.8)
  x <- envs[[1]]$envelope
  plot(x[(length(x) / 9):(length(x) / 4)], type = "l", xlab = "samples", ylab = "amplitude")

  # smoothing and thinning
  envs <- get_envelopes(path = tempdir(), thinning = 1 / 10, smooth = 6.8)
  x <- envs[[1]]$envelope
  plot(x[(length(x) / 9):(length(x) / 4)], type = "l", xlab = "samples", ylab = "amplitude")

  # no normalization
  envs <- get_envelopes(path = tempdir(), thinning = 1 / 10, smooth = 6.8)
  x <- envs[[1]]$envelope
  plot(x[(length(x) / 9):(length(x) / 4)],
    type = "l", xlab = "samples", ylab = "amplitude",
    normalize = FALSE
  )
