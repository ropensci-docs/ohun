# Plot a labeled spectrogram

`label_spectro` plot a spectrogram along with amplitude envelopes or
cross-correlation scores

## Usage

``` r
label_spectro(
  wave,
  reference = NULL,
  detection = NULL,
  envelope = FALSE,
  threshold = NULL,
  smooth = 5,
  collevels = seq(-100, 0, 5),
  palette = viridis::viridis,
  template.correlation = NULL,
  line.x.position = 2,
  hop.size = NULL,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- wave:

  A 'wave' class object.

- reference:

  Data frame or 'selection.table' (following the warbleR package format)
  with the reference selections (start and end of the sound events).
  Must contained at least the following columns: "sound.files", "selec",
  "start" and "end".

- detection:

  Data frame or 'selection.table' with the detection (start and end of
  the sound events) Must contained at least the following columns:
  "sound.files", "selec", "start" and "end".

- envelope:

  Logical to control whether the amplitude envelope is plotted. Default
  is `FALSE`.

- threshold:

  A numeric vector on length 1 indicated the amplitude or correlation
  threshold to plot on the envelope or correlation scores respectively.
  Default is `NULL`. Note that for amplitude the range of valid values
  is 0-1, while for correlations the range is 0-100.

- smooth:

  A numeric vector of length 1 to smooth the amplitude envelope with a
  sum smooth function. It controls the time range (in ms) in which
  amplitude samples are smoothed (i.e. averaged with neighboring
  samples). Default is 5. 0 means no smoothing is applied.

- collevels:

  Numeric sequence of negative numbers to control color partitioning and
  amplitude values that are shown (as in
  [`spectro`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/seewave/man/spectro.html)).

- palette:

  Function with the color palette to be used on the spectrogram (as in
  [`spectro`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/seewave/man/spectro.html))

- template.correlation:

  List extracted from the output of
  [`template_correlator`](https://docs.ropensci.org/ohun/reference/template_correlator.md)
  containing the correlation scores and metadata for an specific sound
  file/template dyad. For instance 'correlations\[\[1\]\]' where
  'correlations' is the output of a
  [`template_correlator`](https://docs.ropensci.org/ohun/reference/template_correlator.md)
  call. If supplied the correlation is also plotted. Default is `NULL`.

- line.x.position:

  Numeric vector of length 1 with the position in the frequency axis (so
  in kHz) of the lines highlighting sound events. Default is 2.

- hop.size:

  A numeric vector of length 1 specifying the time window duration (in
  ms). Default is 11.6 ms, which is equivalent to 512 'wl' for a 44.1
  kHz sampling rate.

- ...:

  Additional arguments to be passed to
  [`spectro`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/seewave/man/spectro.html) for further
  spectrogram customization.

## Value

A spectrogram along with lines highlighting the position of sound events
in 'reference' and/or 'detection'. If supplied it will also plot the
amplitude envelope or corelation scores below the spectrogram.

## Details

This function plots spectrograms annotated with the position of sound
events. **Created for graphs included in the vignette, and probably only
useful for that or for very short recordings**. Only works on a single
'wave' object at the time.

## Examples

``` r
{
  # load example data
  data(list = "lbh1", "lbh_reference")

  # adding labels
  label_spectro(
    wave = lbh1,
    reference = lbh_reference[lbh_reference$sound.files == "lbh1.wav", ],
    wl = 200, ovlp = 50, flim = c(1, 10)
  )

  # adding envelope
  label_spectro(
    wave = lbh1,
    detection = lbh_reference[lbh_reference$sound.files == "lbh1.wav", ],
    wl = 200, ovlp = 50, flim = c(1, 10)
  )
