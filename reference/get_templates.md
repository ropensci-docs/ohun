# Find templates representative of the structural variation of sound events

`get_templates` find the sound events that are closer to the acoustic
space centroid (i.e. close to the average acoustic structure) in a
reference table.

## Usage

``` r
get_templates(
  reference,
  acoustic.space = NULL,
  path = ".",
  n.sub.spaces = 1,
  plot = TRUE,
  color = "#21908C4D",
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- reference:

  Selection table (using the warbleR package's format, see
  [`selection_table`](https://marce10.github.io/warbleR/reference/selection_table.html))
  or data frame with columns for sound file name (sound.files),
  selection number (selec), and start and end time of sound event (start
  and end).

- acoustic.space:

  Numeric matrix or data frame with the two dimensions of a custom
  acoustic space to be used for finding templates. if not supplied the
  acoustic space is calculated internally (default). Optional. Note that
  the function assumes that 'reference' and 'acoustic.space' refer to
  the same sound events and similarly ordered.

- path:

  Character string containing the directory path where the sound files
  are located. The current working directory is used as default.

- n.sub.spaces:

  Integer vector of length 1 with the number of sub-spaces to split the
  total acoustic space. If `n.sub.spaces = 1`, only the sound event
  closer to the centroid is returned. If `n.sub.spaces > 1` the function
  returns additional sound events, corresponding to those closer to the
  centroids of the sub-spaces. To do this, the function defines
  sub-spaces as equal-size slices of a circle centered at the centroid
  of the acoustic space.

- plot:

  Logical to control if the plot is created. Default is `TRUE`.

- color:

  Character string with the point color. Default is '#21908C4D'.

- ...:

  Additional arguments to be passed to
  [`spectro_analysis`](https://marce10.github.io/warbleR/reference/spectro_analysis.html)
  for further customization when measuring parameters to calculate the
  acoustic space.

## Value

The function returns a 'selection_table' (warbleR package's formats, see
[`selection_table`](https://marce10.github.io/warbleR/reference/selection_table.html))
or data frame (if sound files can't be found) containing the start and
end of each sound event by sound file.

## Details

This function finds sound events (from a reference table) that are
representative of the acoustic structure variation of all sound events.
This is done by finding the events closer to the centroid of the
acoustic space. If the acoustic space is not supplied ('acoustic.space'
argument) then the function will estimate it by measuring several
acoustic features using the function
[`spectro_analysis`](https://marce10.github.io/warbleR/reference/spectro_analysis.html)
(features related to energy distribution in the frequency and time
domain as well as features of the dominant frequency contours, see
[`spectro_analysis`](https://marce10.github.io/warbleR/reference/spectro_analysis.html)
for more details) and summarizing it with Principal Component Analysis
(after z-transforming parameters) using the function
[`prcomp`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/prcomp.html). Acoustic features with
missing values are removed before estimating Principal Component
Analysis. The rationale is that a sound event close to the average
structure is more likely to share structural features with most events
across the acoustic space than a sound event in the periphery of the
space. If only 1 template is required the function returns the sound
event closest to the acoustic space centroid. If more than 1 template is
required additional sound events are returned that are representative of
the acoustic space. To do this, the function defines sub-spaces as
equal-size slices of a circle centered at the centroid of the acoustic
space. A column 'template' is included in the output selection table
that identifies each template. Custom acoustic spaces can be supplied
with argument 'acoustic.space'. Notice that the function aims to
partition spaces in which sounds are somehow homogeneously distributed.
When clear clusters are found in the distribution of the acoustic space
thus clusters might not match the sub-spaces defined by the function.

  # Save example files into temporary working directory
  data("lbh1", "lbh2", "lbh_reference")
  tuneR::writeWave(lbh1, file.path(tempdir(), "lbh1.wav"))
  tuneR::writeWave(lbh2, file.path(tempdir(), "lbh2.wav"))

  # get a single mean template
  template <- get_templates(reference = lbh_reference, path = tempdir())

  # get 3 templates
  template <- get_templates(reference = lbh_reference, n.sub.spaces = 3, path = tempdir())
}
